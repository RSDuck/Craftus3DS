## Features!
* A world which is theoretically infinite
* Super exciting super flat worlds
* Stereo 3D
* Making every block in direct sight line to stone(so almost building and breaking blocks)
* Ambient Occlusion(these shadows in the edges between the cubes)

## Upcoming features
* Building and breaking blocks
* A hand and a crosshair
* A even more exciting world generation with hills and maybe some trees
* Saving and opening worlds
* Some more optimiziation to let the game run on O3DS with 3D enabled with stable 30-40 FPS
* (Maybe) support for Minecraft Ressourcepacks or atleast a custom format and a converter for PC

## Credits
* Of course to those who made 3DS homebrew possible(too many to be listed here)
* Everybody who wrote something for 3DS and made it open source
* The textures come from the Minecraft Ressourcepack Pixel Perfect by XSSheep which is licensed under CC-BY-SA. The file "Pixel Perfection V3.5.zip" is a full copy of it. The folder romfs/textures contains single textures and one map with multiple textures put on it. For more informations about the Ressourcepack see here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1242533-pixel-perfection-freshly-updated-1-10
* Craftus also depends on several other small but very useful libraries packaged in the deps folder

I called the folder zscreenshot because I want to have in my editor(VSCode) to be lower than the source folder
